# CALCULATOR

Nology Wk2 Caluclator Project


Calculator flaws to be addressed;
  - Multiple entry of decimal point to be fixed
  - Allow continued calculation without pressing "="
  - Adjustments to negatise button, at the moment, its only +/- on the displayArry
  - Sort binary 0.1 + 0.2 problem
  - Needs word/text wrap/break on output display to prevent going off calc.
  - Needs clear last as well as clear all
  - % button to be added
  - When delete has removed the full number, put something in the display
  - 

Design issues to resolve;
  - Require media query to change for phone screen size
  - Change operation buttons colour
  - Change effect on press
  - Add on/off button with sound.......possible animation?!?
  - Change bot.right radius of "=" key to match bot.right radius of calc-container
